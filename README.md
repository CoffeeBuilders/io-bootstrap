## Create and run a basic HTML/CSS/Javascript page in a webserver

## Create the project

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Change directories to your projects directory (for example `cd ~/projects`).
3. Create a new project with `mkdir my-sweet-project`.
4. Change directory into the project directory you just created `cd my-sweet-project`.
5. Create an html, a css, and a Javascript file with `touch index.html index.css index.js`
6. Open this folder in your editor.

### Run the project in a web server

1. Go back to your terminal, make sure you're still in your `my-sweet-project` directory (or whatever you called it).
2. Serve up the files using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
3. Go to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser.
4. It will be empty, but when you add some html to your page and refresh the page with `Command+R` it should show up.
